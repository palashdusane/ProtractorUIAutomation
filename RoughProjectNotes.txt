Realtime Project Notes:
* Create new node project (dummy package.json file) by using: npm init 
It will ask some project metadata, press "enter" if you want to keep it default
package.json will be created
Lets install dependencies which are required for the project
Find dependencies from official documentation (website)
https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/5.4.1/exampleTypescript/package.json
Add dependencies in package.json file (write all in file), then use command: npm install
@types are used to convert particular node(js) modules in typescript, as node doesn't understand ts.
* Create test spec file (typescript) to open official protractor website in jasmine + typescript for now.
Now create ts configuration file (conf.ts) to run test spec file
Protractor compiler is designed to run js files only, so we need to convert ts file to js for successful run.
* Create tsconfig json file using command: tsc --init (or tsc.cmd --init on powershell)
https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/5.4.1/exampleTypescript/tsconfig.json 
It will help to convert typescript to javascript
compile all ts file to js using command: tsc (or tsc.cmd)
now run your specs using command: protractor JSFiles/conf.js
